## Research

I am interested on Bayesian Analysis, especially on Bayesian Nonparametric models. My research is based on exploring innovative approaches in model-based clustering. I am currently working on:

-    Bayesian clustering methods with high dimensional data;

-    Multivariate time series with changepoint detection.

-   Topic modelling techniques with distributions defined on the simplex.

## Research projects
