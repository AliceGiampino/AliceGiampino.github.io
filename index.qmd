To find truth, <br> one must travel through a dense fog.<br> (David Dweck)
</p>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistics at the <strong><a href="https://www.dems.unimib.it/en" target="_blank">Department of Economics, Management and Statistics (DEMS)</a></strong>, at the <strong><a href="https://en.unimib.it" target="_blank">University of Milano-Bicocca</a></strong>. My research focuses primarily on Bayesian statistical methods for modeling high-dimensional data, time series, with particular emphasis on clustering and inference.

I work on various projects involving the application of statistics across different fields, and I truly enjoy teaching statistics. Iâ€™m passionate about sharing statistical knowledge, I also took part of several projects to spread Statistics with high school students. I also serve as a Research Fellow Representative at DEMS.

Outside of academia, I love hiking, gardening, and spending time in the mountains.
